<h2>The Work I did Trough my CS50 Course</h2>

Firstly, I learned about binary code, diffrent coding schemes. Also I learned about parts of a computer, how computers store data, acess to information trough internet and some common problems computers can encounter while trying to get data from the web. Other than that, I learned how to code in .html and multipile .css properties. I built a website that gives information about some fish species in North America. This website also links to another website which contains more information about the same species.
