<h4>2.9.2024 </h4>

  Today I read the pages 0-46 from the book Develop​ in Swift
AP CS Principles. This is my summary about Unit 1 Values: Computer programs and computers work with inputs and outputs. Input is the information that we type in to to computer for the computer to process and give us information. The informstion that the computer gives us are outputs. Outputs can be understood by our sense organs. The information that is put and took out of the computer can be in diffrent types. For example if it contains numbers it could be a integer or if it contains text it could be a string. The information that computers process could also be called data. Data is a large pack which consist of seperate values. These values make up data and then, the data can be processed for the computer to inspect the values individually and come up with a solution. Also when typing in an input or when examining an output, specific naming and identifiers could be used. These elements would be used in a universal way which lets anyone undertand what the input or output is about, what is the goal of the input, why was the input typed in this specific way etc. For example instead of writing a numerical formula which calculates how fast a pool would fill up using a sink that has a specific flow rate, we could write the equation and then write what which numbers stand for in a string. Another topic covered in the book are constans and variables. They are both types of values. While constans have a value that is stable and is always the samei values of variables could change. Using all the values, data, input and outputs; computer programmers could build a simulation that works in for a solution of a unique problem.

Today I wrote my first code in Xcode that prints: Hello, Ata. Here is my code: 
   <p></p>
      <p></p>
import UIKit
   <p></p>
let greeting="Hello "    <p></p>
let name="Ata "   <p></p>
print("\(greeting)\(name)")   <p></p>

I also created a Photo Phrame app form Xcode(Couldn't be loaded yet). Other than that,
I took notes from the videos I watched from Collegeboard: The first topic is collabration. Collabration that includes diverse perspectives has  alot of benefits. Some of these benefits are, collabratrion helps avoid bias, it helps produce a computing innovation, it reflects diversity and it makes solving problems easier with a partner. While collabrating; consensus building, conflict resolution, negotiation and communication skills are learnt. Also there are a few types of collabrating. Two of these that were also mentioned in the video are pair programming and think-pair-share. In the next chapter, computing innovations were explained. Also while colabratting, comments are used to make the other side informed about the goal and function of each program statement. Some examples to computing innovations can be cell phones, social media and cloud services. These are innpvations that all work to solve a unique problem using programming. Also, the input can come from some person or from some website. If the input differentiates, the output can also differentiate. Inputs can be tactile, visual, with a click or a text and audial. When an input is entered, the program trigers the related code segment, it doesn't run the whole code. Also Programs are made of code segments that are made of program statements (lines of code). While designing a program, investigating is always important. Developers also must determine the requirments of the desired program, understand the constrains of it and also understanding the user interests. When developers develop a website, they brainstorm, storyboard, plan user experience, leyout user interface, organize in modules and develop a testing strategy. THis means that a development process can be ordered. Lastly, credits should be given to the person who wrote the code that the developer got from somewhere else and used in his own code. Every single person who has even a very small benefit to the program should be creditted.
